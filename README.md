# Student Performance Predictor & GPA Analyst 

An analytical tool designed to enhance students' academic visibility and performance through data-driven simulations. Currently in its **MVP Phase**.

##  Features
- **Data Integration:** Seamlessly reads academic records exported as CSV files using the `pandas` library.
- **Simulation Engine:** Features a "Simulation Mode" where students can input hypothetical grades to forecast their CGPA impact.
- **Visual Analytics:** Implements `matplotlib` to generate comparative charts between current status and simulated projections.

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy

##  Future Roadmap (The Data Science Evolution)
- **Phase 2:** Synthetic data generation of thousands of student profiles to train predictive models.
- **Phase 3:** Integration of **Monte Carlo Simulations** to calculate the probability of achieving specific CGPA targets.
- **Phase 4:** Implementation of a **Linear Regression** model ($y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$) to identify performance trends over semesters.
- **Phase 5:** Advanced Deep Learning layer using **PyTorch** for non-linear success prediction.
